Description: CourseFinder is a website and social computing app that allows higher education users to do 
one of two things: 
1. Take a personality test to match them with a course in a given department at Swarthmore College
2. Contribute feedback and descriptive data about a course they have taken to help us build an 
expansive database of courses possible for our users.
